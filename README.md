# Godbound System

![Foundry v10](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v10-green)

This system is based initially off of the boilerplate system which provided a great starting point. All major work has been done except for a few remaining tabs on the Character and NPC sheets.  Planned Dynamic Effects and other loftier goals have not been attempted yet, but the foundation is there for it.  The system is functional (with the aforementioned caveats) and has been in use in our gaming group.
